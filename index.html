        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="introinfo">
          <h2>Personal Details | Introduction</h2>
          <p>Hey, so I am a 20 year old student currently studying Networking Technologies in the Technological University of Dublin (TUD). I'm currently in my second year of this course with my final year of this course set to be in 2021 along with the new Grangegorman campus.<br><br>I'm an avid learner with an interest in just about anything if I can find a use for it in my life after all why not try make life more interesting or simpler? I particularly like taking an calculated approach to life by keeping everything organised if possible as every little counts in my book. There's also just no reason to stress myself under the pressure of deadlines if I are able to meet them beforehand which is why I try complete work early and to a high degree and consistency. Usually I find myself managing group projects but I also do not mind doing work by myself.<br> <br> Ideally after finishing this course I hope to be working in the industry as a "Network Engineer" but I also have the option of completing an additional year to achieve a Level 8 QQI degree. But that isn't to say I wont look for a career in another sector especially if it interests me.<br> <br> </p>

          <h2>Skills | Interests</h2>
          <p>Over the years I've gained and learned quite a few skills, Some through formal education and some during my free time. I'm an avid learner always keen on improving my existing skills or learning new ones.<br> <br>Starting off with skills I speak two languages fluently: English and Cantonese and I am currently learning Japanese in my free time. I can program in multiple languages such as Java, Javascript, C, Python, HTML, CSS. I have proficiency in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, Microsoft Office Suite and Fruity Loops Studio.<br>Interests wise I enjoy exploring creative outputs such as photography and music. There is just something different to me of conveying a mood or feeling through an image as opposed to words. I enjoy the level of detail and creative input that comes with doing photography. Music I find plays a crucial part in my daily life whether it be helping me focus or relax at the end of the day.</p>

          <h2>My Education</h2>
          <p><br>I started attending TUDublin formerly Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) in September 2018 studying Networking Technologies (DT080A).<br><br> The course itself focuses mainly upon the cisco CCNA certification as well as practical work done in computer labs. In these lab's we are taught how to implement various network protocols on cisco switches and routers to create a local network. As for other modules they focus on the engineering aspect of being a network engineer.<br><br>Find out more about my education here!</p>

          <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
          <p><br>I have a variety of hobbies from photography to building computers but I am always looking to expand my hobbies. I enjoy hobbies that can be quite technical and require a decent amount of research beforehand.<br><br> There's nothing quite like having a new found respect for people who's career is based off a certain thing such as photographers, musicians, artists and engineers. Although I may never reach the same skill and level as others that's exactly why it's a hobby for me.<br><br>Find out more about my hobbies here!</p>
